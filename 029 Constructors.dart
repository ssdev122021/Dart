# A constructor is a special kind of a method.
# It is automatically called when the object is created.
# Constructors do not return values.
# The purpose of the constructor is to initiate the state of an object.
# Constructors have the same name as the class.
# If you donâ€™t declare a constructor, a default no-argument constructor is provided for you.
 
# Dart provides named constructors to enable a class define multiple constructors
